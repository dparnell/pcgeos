	Some new commands were added to DOS version and GEOS version of PCCom.
The following is the new commands and their syntax:

<ESC>LL<path>!	
	Long listing of files. LL command displays the following in addition to
        normal LS command:

	  DOS attributes, a: archive
			  d: sub directory
			  v: volume file
			  s: system
			  h: hidden
			  r: read only
	  GEOS name, 	  32 char file name
	  release number,  
	  creator,
	  token,
	  protocol number,

	Creator and other geode token are displayed in the following format:

		"4-letter token"[Manufacturer's name]

	The following is the known manufacturers, and I thought I would 
	translate it for the user.  But if ID is larger than 9, it will 
	display the ID itself.

	ManufacturerTable	dword \
		'GEO', 0,		; GEOWORKS 		0
		'APP', 0,		; APP_LOCAK		1
		'PLM', 0,		; PALM_COMPUTING	2
		'WIZ', 0,		; WIZARD		3
		'CLB', 0,		; CREATIVE_LABS		4
		'DSL', 0,		; DOS_LAUNCHER		5
		'AOL', 0,		; AMERICA_ONLINE	6
		'ITU', 0,		; INTUIT		7
		'SDK', 0,		; SDK			8
		'AGD', 0		; AGD			9

<ESC>LM<path>!
	Medium listing of files. This is LL without creator, geode token, and
	protocol number.  As you will notice, LL will display 2 lines of info
	per file.  LM displays one line per file.

<ESC>AD 
	Available drives.  Displays all the drives known to the system with
	their disk labels.

<ESC>FS<driveLetter>:!
	Displays the amount of free space in the specified driver.  If path is
	omitted, displays free space on current driver.

<ESC>EB(On|Off)!
	Turns echo back on or off.  If echo back is on, all the output to the
	server side is echoed back to client.  If argument is omitted, displays
	the current status of echo back.  On/off string is case insensitive.

<ESC>AK(On|Off)!
	Turns acknowledgement on or off.  If ack is on, <ESC>ACK sequence is 
	sent from server to client when a command is successful, or <ESC>NAK
	if command is unsuccessful.  By omitting On|Off arg, you can get the 
	current status of acknowledgement.

Original specification for pccom extension is found in:
	mudslide\eng:\eng\tech.doc\network


TECHNICAL NOTE

	One implementation change is that, in PCCom library, output strings are
gathered into one string block and sent out at once when a command ends or 
when the string block gets too big.  See StringBlockStart/Write/Send functions.


BUG

	In DOS version of PCCom, AD function does not check A: and B: drives.
But, it just assumes that they exist.  Before we make it check A:/B: drives,
we need to intercept critical error handler.
