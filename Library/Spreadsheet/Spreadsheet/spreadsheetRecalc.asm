DESCRIPTION:
	Code to do recalculation.

NOTES:
	I keep a cell-list which consists of cells to handle and cells
	which have been handled.

	I use the CRC_ABSOLUTE flag for the cell row to determine if
	a cell has been handled already.
	
	I use the CRC_ABSOLUTE flag for the cell column to determine if
	a cell has been handled and has been determined to be part of
	a circular reference loop.

	CF_current.RV_TEXT is a size; FP_nChars is a length.

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		ForeachDependency
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Call a callback for each dependent of a cell

CALLED BY:	AppendDependentsToCellList, AppendNamePrecedentsToCellList
PASS:		ds:si	= Spreadsheet instance
		es:di	= Pointer to the cell
		ax	= Near routine to call for each cell in the dependency
			  list.
RETURN:		carry set if callback aborted.
			ax set by callback only if aborted.
		es	= Segment address of same block it was when we got here
DESTROYED:	nothing (although blocks may move around due to the callback)

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	Callback will be passed:
		All registers the same as were passed in except:
		ds:si	= Spreadsheet instance
		*es:bx	= Pointer to dependency list block
		(*es:bx)+di = Pointer to the current dependency list entry
		dx	= Row of the cell
		cx	= Column of the cell
	It can return carry set to abort processing.
	It may destroy ax

KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
	The cells are processed in this order:
		Foreach block (first to last)
		    Foreach entry in the block (last to first)

	Callback routines can count on this order.
	
	This may be useful. You can tell when you have reached the last
	dependency because the following will be true when the callback
	is called:
		di = size DependencyListHeader
		(*es:bx).DLH_next.segment == 0
