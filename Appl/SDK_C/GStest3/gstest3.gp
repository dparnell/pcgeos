# Permanent name: is required by Glue to set the permanent name and extension
# of the geode. The permanent name of a library is what goes in the imported
# library table of a geode (along with the protocol number). It is also
# what Swat uses to name the patient.
#
name     gstest3.app
#
# Long filename: this name can displayed by geoManager, and is used to identify
# the application for inter-application communication.

# Specify geode type: is an application, will have its own process (thread),
# and is not multi-launchable.

type	appl, process, single

# Specify class name for application process. Methods sent to the Application's
# process will be handled by the GStest3ProcessClass, which is defined
# in gstest3.asm.

# Specify application object. This is the object in the .ui file which serves
# as the top-level UI object in the application.

#
# Token: this four-letter name is used by geoManager to locate the icon for this
# application in the database.

tokenid    8

# Heapspace: This is roughly the non-discardable memory usage (in words)
# of the application and any transient libraries that it depends on,
# plus an additional amount for thread activity. To find the heapspace
# for an application, use the Swat "heapspace" command.

# Libraries: list which libraries are used by the application.

# Resources: list all resource blocks which are used by the application.
