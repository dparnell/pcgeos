# Heapspace: This is roughly the non-discardable memory usage (in words)

# Mark the DisplayUI resource as shared and read-only so its handle will be
# shared between instances of this application. The resource will never come
# into memory as itself, but always as a copy of itself, so it can safely be
# shared.

# Exported entry points. To allow the relocation of the DocumentUI resource
# to occur and be independent of insignificant (as far as the operation of
# the application is concerned) changes in the physical location of the
# DVDocumentClass class record, the relocation information for the
# GenDocumentGroup object specifies the class to use for document objects
# as an exported routine number for this application. Entry point numbers
# change far less frequently, and only for much greater cause, than the
# offsets of variables and routines.
