# Permanent name: is required by Glue to set the permanent name and extension
# of the geode. The permanent name of a library is what goes in the imported
# library table of a client geode (along with the protocol number). It is also
# what Swat uses to name the patient.
#
name pccom1.app
#
# Long filename: this name can displayed by GeoManager. "EC " is prepended to
# this when the error-checking version is linked by Glue.

# Specify geode type: is an application, and will have its own thread started
# for it by the kernel.

type	appl, process, single
#
# Specify class name for application thread. Messages sent to the application
# thread (aka "process" when specified as the output of a UI object) will be
# handled by the PCCom1ProcessClass, which is defined in pccom1.goc.

# Specify application object. This is the object that serves as the top-level
# UI object in the application. See pccom1.goc.

# Token: this four-letter+integer name is used by GeoManager to locate the
# icon for this application in the token database. So that the token will
# be unique, the token id corresponds to the manufacturer ID of the program's
# author. Since this is a sample application, we use the manufacturer id of
# the SDK, which is 8.

# Libraries: list which libraries are used by the application.

library	ui

#
# Resources: list all resource blocks which are used by the application whose
# allocation flags can't be inferred by Glue. Usually this is needed only for
# object blocks, fixed code resources, or data resources that are read-only.
# Standard discardable code resources do not need to be mentioned.
