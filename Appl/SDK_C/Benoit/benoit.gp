# Permanent name: is required by Glue to set the permanent name and extension
# of the geode. The permanent name of a library is what goes in the imported
# library table of a geode (along with the protocol number). It is also
# what Swat uses to name the patient.
#
name benoit.app
#
# Long filename: this name can displayed by geoManager, and is used to identify
# the application for inter-application communication.

longname "C Benoit"

# Specify geode type: is an application, and will have its own process
# (thread).  By the way, it's multi-launchable...
#
type	appl, process
#
# Specify class name for application process. Methods sent to the Application's
# process will be handled by the GeoFileProcessClass, which is defined
# in geofile.asm.

class	BProcessClass
#
# Specify application object. This is the object in the .ui file which serves
# as the top-level UI object in the application.

#
# Token: this four-letter name is used by geoManager to locate the icon for 
# this application in the database.
#
tokenchars "SAMP"
tokenid 8
#
# Heapspace: This is roughly the non-discardable memory usage (in words)
# of the application and any transient libraries that it depends on,
# plus an additional amount for thread activity. To find the heapspace
# for an application, use the Swat "heapspace" command.
#
heapspace 6353
#
# Libraries: list which libraries are used by the application.
#
library	geos
library	ui
library mset		# use the Mandelbrot Set Library
#
# Resources: list all resource blocks which are used by the application.
#
# Mark the DisplayUI resource as shared and read-only so its handle will be
# shared between instances of this application. The resource will never come
# into memory as itself, but always as a copy of itself, so it can safely be
# shared.

# Exported entry points. To allow the relocation of the DocumentUI resource
# to occur and be independent of insignificant (as far as the operation of
# the application is concerned) changes in the physical location of the
# BDocumentClass class record, the relocation information for the
# GenDocumentGroup object specifies the class to use for document objects
# as an exported routine number for this application. Entry point numbers
# change far less frequently, and only for much greater cause, than the
# offsets of variables and routines.
