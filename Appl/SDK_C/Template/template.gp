# Permanent name: is required by Glue to set the permanent name and extension
# of the geode. The permanent name of a library is what goes in the imported
# library table of a geode (along with the protocol number). It is also
# what Swat uses to name the patient.
#
name     template.app
#
# Long filename: this name can displayed by geoManager, and is used to identify
# the application for inter-application communication.

longname "C Template"

# Specify geode type: is an application, will have its own process (thread),
# and is not multi-launchable.
#
type   appl, process, single
#
# Specify class name for application process. Methods sent to the Application's
# process will be handled by the process class.

class  TemplateProcessClass
#
# Specify application object. This is the object in the .ui file which serves
# as the top-level UI object in the application.

#
# Token: this four-letter name is used by geoManager to locate the icon for this
# application in the database.

tokenchars "TEMP"
tokenid    8
#
# Heapspace: This is roughly the non-discardable memory usage
# of the application and any transient libraries that it depends on,
# plus an additional amount for thread activity. To find the heapspace
# for an application, use the Swat "heapspace" command.
