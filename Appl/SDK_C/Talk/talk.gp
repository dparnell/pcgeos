#
# Permanent name: is required by Glue to set the permanent name and extension
# of the geode. The permanent name of a library is what goes in the imported
# library table of a client geode (along with the protocol number). It is also
# what Swat uses to name the patient.
#
name talk.app
#
# Long filename: this name can displayed by GeoManager. "EC " is prepended to
# this when the error-checking version is linked by Glue.
#
longname "Talk Demo"
#
# Token: The four-letter name is used by GeoManager to locate the
# icon for this application in the token database. The tokenid
# number corresponds to the manufacturer ID of the program's author
# for uniqueness of the token. Since this is a sample application, we
# use the manufacturer ID for the SDK, which is 8.

type	appl, process
#
# Specify class name for application thread. Messages sent to the application
# thread (aka "process" when specified as the output of a UI object) will be
# handled by the HelloProcessClass, which is defined in hello2.goc.

# Specify application object. This is the object that serves as the top-level

# Heapspace: This is roughly the non-discardable memory usage (in words)
# of the application and any transient libraries that it depends on,
# plus an additional amount for thread activity. To find the heapspace
# for an application, use the Swat "heapspace" command.

#
# Resources: list all resource blocks which are used by the application whose
# allocation flags can't be inferred by Glue. Usually this is needed only for
# object blocks, fixed code resources, or data resources that are read-only.
# Standard discardable code resources do not need to be mentioned.
